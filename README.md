Personal Project - Simple web application to handle food orders.

## To Do:
- [x] Change table numbers
- [ ] Optimize code structure (configs instead of duplicate code)
- [ ] Make seperate button to test print in nav bar
- [ ] Print without the preview (chrome flag doesn't work)
- [x] Make buttons even larger 
- [ ] Display selected options with the order in history
- [ ] Fix bug when logged in but still redirected to login screen
